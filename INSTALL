# Quick Start
## Installing Sassetti

First, put all the files in the Sassetti distribution (e.g. this directory)
in a convenient place (e.g. ~/src/lisp/sassetti).  

Second, you need to tell your lisp install where that place is.
Sassetti relies on Zach Beane's Quicklisp system for loading
dependencies, so link sassetti.asd to some place quicklisp can find
it.  On my box, I do:

    ln -s ~/src/list/sassetti/sassetti.asd ~/quicklisp/quicklisp/

Now you can [run Sassetti](#running_sassetti) from there or make an executable version of
Sassetti with `make bin`.

## Dependencies
All of the following must be present via quickload.  Fortunately, they
are all in the standard Quicklisp distribution.

* Sassetti relies on Quicklisp to load dependencies (and itself), so
  make sure quicklisp is loaded before sassetti, either automatically
  or manually.

* Parsing ledger formatted files depends on regular expressions, so
  cl-ppcre needs to be present.

* We use FiveAm for testing.  You can comment it out in the source if
  you aren't interested in the unit tests.

* We have a dependency on iterate, but we don't actually use it yet.

* We use split-sequence for some text processing.

The documentation has some dependencies too.

* GNU make processes the /docs Makefile.

* Markdown is used to format and style docs.

* Pandoc converts the markdown to different formats.

* PDFLatex generates pdf versions of the documentation.

## Building the Documentation

Documentation has been collected into a pdf that can be built using
`make doc`.

## Running Sassetti 

Start your lisp environment using `M-x slime` in emacs or `sbcl` at
the commandline.  Then load Sassetti with `(ql:quickload 'sassetti)`.
Once Sassetti is loaded, you can invoke it or use any of its
subroutines as in `(sassetti:sassetti)`.
