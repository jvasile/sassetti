# Quick Start
## Installing Sassetti

First, put all the files in the Sassetti distribution (e.g. this directory)
in a convenient place (e.g. ~/src/lisp/sassetti).  

Second, you need to tell your lisp install where that place is.
Sassetti relies on Zach Beane's Quicklisp system for loading
dependencies, so link sassetti.asd to some place quicklisp can find
it.  On my box, I do:

    ln -s ~/src/list/sassetti/sassetti.asd ~/quicklisp/quicklisp/

## Dependencies

All of the following must be present via quickload.  Fortunately, they
are all in the standard Quicklisp distribution.

* Parsing ledger formatted files depends on regular expressions, so
  cl-ppcre needs to be present.

* We use FiveAm for testing.  You can comment it out in the source if
you aren't interested in the unit tests.

* We have a dependency on iterate, but we don't actually use it yet.

* We use split-sequence for some text processing.

* GNU make processes the Makefile, which allows us to assemble documentation.

## Building the Documentation

The first time you run make, you need to run it twice.  The first run
sets up some symlinks that are needed for later operation.  It will
also make some stunted versions of some of the docs.  The second run
actually builds the good stuff.  

After that first run, though, you should be able to build the
documentation with just one invocation of make.

    cd doc
    make
    make

## Running Sassetti

Start your lisp environment using one of the following:

    M-x slime (in emacs)
    sbcl (at the commandline)

Then load Sassetti

    (ql:quickload 'sassetti)

Or, using sbcl from the commandline

    sbcl --eval "(ql:quickload 'sassetti)"
