# Introduction

Sassetti is a Common Lisp reimplementation of John Wiegley's
commandline Ledger program.  The goal is to harness the power of
Wiegley's simple tools and extend them with the flexibility of lisp.

## Overview

Sassetti is designed to read Ledger files and do with them exactly
what ledger would, except for a few minor variations.  First, Sassetti
is in some places more forgiving than Ledger about spacing.  Second,
and more importantly, Sassetti allows you to include lisp commands
among your standard Ledger entries.  These get evaluated by Sassetti,
perhaps generating new entries or changing how data is interpreted.
