# Hacking

I'm using the FiveAM testing framework to keep the code well-covered
by tests in test.lisp.  To accomplish this, I am writing tests as I
write code and will not consider a bug closed until it is accompanied
by appropriate tests.

If you are interested in helping out, writing tests is a great place
to start-- you don't need to know much about the code or lisp to write
useful tests.

## Before Submitting or Pushing

There are a easy ways to test code before inflicting it on others.

First, run all the unit tests with `(test-all).  If any of them fail,
it should mean your changes broke something, as my goal is to always
keep master in a state where all tests get passed.

Second, close your lisp session and reload Sassetti in a fresh
environment.  That will help ensure that your code's functionality
doesn't depend on quirks of your lisp session.
