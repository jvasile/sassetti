# Hacking

I'm using the FiveAM testing framework to keep the code well-covered
by tests in test.lisp.  To accomplish this, I am writing tests as I
write code and will not consider a bug closed until it is accompanied
by appropriate tests.

If you are interested in helping out, writing tests is a great place
to start-- you don't need to know much about the code or lisp to write
useful tests.
