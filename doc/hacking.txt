# Hacking

I'm using the FiveAM testing framework to keep the code well-covered
by tests in test.lisp.  To accomplish this, I am writing tests as I
write code and will not consider a bug closed until it is accompanied
by appropriate tests.

If you are interested in helping out, writing tests is a great place
to start-- you don't need to know much about the code or lisp to write
useful tests.

## Repository

Sassetti is available from github at
`git://github.com/jvasile/sassetti.git`.  The [project page on
github](https://github.com/jvasile/sassetti) is at
`https://github.com/jvasile/sassetti`.

## Bugs

Any place where Sassetti does something different from Ledger (except
for being a little less strict in accepting input) is probably a bug.

Any time lisp doesn't do the expected thing, it's also probably a bug.
Sassetti should never crash and dump the user to the debugger.
Unfortunately, I haven't put in any error handling yet, so crashes
will result from malformed input.  That will change.

## Todo

* parse.lisp:  TODO: handle dates in the note section
* parse.lisp:  TODO: do we need to trim leading space from the note?
